gtuna is a chromatic guitar tuner for your Linux box using ncurses (it was born
as a guitar tuner, but it should be good as a tuner for any instrument connected
on your computer's mic).

Q: How can I install it?
A:Just type `make` and press enter. Nothing more.
*N.B.* The requirement for getting gtuna working is having libfftw3-dev and
libncurses-dev installed on your machine.

Q: How does it work?
A: Just plug your instrument into the mic entrance of your computer, and pick a
string. In green you can see the recognized note, in branches () the computed
frequency of the sound, in square branches [] the minimum frequency for the
recognized note, the effective ideal frequency and the maximum frequency, and a
final string:

-- means the computed frequency is very low for the computed note (so you need
to pull that string up)
- means the computed frequency is slightly low for the computed note
O means the computed frequency is ok for the computed note
+ means the computed frequency is slightly high for the computed note
++ means the computed frequency is very high for the computed note (so you need
to pull that string down)
